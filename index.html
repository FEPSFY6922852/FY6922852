    Wing flaps are the movable surfaces on the trailing edge of a plane’s wings. 
    By changing their positions, pilots can change the camber (curvature) of the wing 
    to achieve the desired amount of drag and lift for any scenario. (Johnston 2023. 
    This article will explore their origins, and heavy impact on aviation today.

               George Cayley was one of the first pioneers of aircraft, being the first to move from ornithopter like devices to fixed wing aircraft. (Bilstein 2025) He discovered that the cambered nature
               of a bird’s wing produced much more lift than a flat wing (Bilstein 2025). This was due to Bernoulli’s principle. The curved top half of the wing was longer; therefore, air must travel 
               faster over it. Resulting in a slower moving, higher-pressure air beneath the wing, pushing it upwards. Following George Cayley, others began studying the science of wings, most notably 
               the Wright brothers and Francis H Wenham, who was responsible for building the first wind tunnel. (Bilstein 2025)
